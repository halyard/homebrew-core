  # From the PCRE homepage:
  # "The older, but still widely deployed PCRE library, originally released in
  # 1997, is at version 8.45. This version of PCRE is now at end of life, and
  # is no longer being actively maintained. Version 8.45 is expected to be the
  # final release of the older PCRE library, and new projects should use PCRE2
  # instead."
